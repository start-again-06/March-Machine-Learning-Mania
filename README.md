📊 Predictive Probability Distribution Visualization

This repository contains a Python script for visualizing the distribution of predicted probabilities using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 🖼️

✨ Features

📈 Creates a histogram of predicted probabilities using sns.histplot from Seaborn.

📊 Implements Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) for smoother visualization.

🎨 Uses Matplotlib to configure figure size and enhance plot aesthetics.

🏷️ Labels axes and provides a descriptive title for better interpretation.

🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:

📦 Matplotlib for plot rendering and figure customization.

📦 Seaborn for statistical data visualization, including histograms and KDE plots.

📦 Pandas for handling and processing the dataset.

🚀 Usage

Ensure your dataset is in a Pandas DataFrame format with a column containing predicted probability values. 📄

Use the script to generate and display the probability distribution plot using Seaborn and Matplotlib. 🖥️

Adjust bin size, figure size, and KDE settings to refine the visualization. 🎛️
